# MESC_FOC_ESC Licence

This hardware is licenced under the 3 clause BSD, with one extra stipulation, and addition of the term HARDWARE DESIGN:

THIS SOFTWARE/HARDWARE DESIGN IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE/HARDWARE DESIGN, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

Additionally:
4. 
a) Any production of this, or a close derivative of this must include a "based on" or "derived from" reference to this project and version on the silkscreen, and identification of the manufacturer and person or entity who organised manufacture and distribution.
b) This clause is optional where this has been integrated as a module into a larger product, from which this module could not reasonably be expected to be re-used. This would be considered the case for any product that has undergone legitimate CE marking or assessment by a national notified body, or where it is integrated into a larger board for specific purpose or irreversably affixed, but would not be considered the case for, e.g. a drone or Ebike conversion kit where the end user could realistically remove and use it for another purpose.


End of Licence

# Explanation:

The modification to this is purely and simply to ensure that if someone takes this and manufactures it, any end user is able to find the relevant documentation to make use of it - avoid further proliferation of nameless ebay and Alibaba boards that are near impossibleto work out how to use.
It is not intended to prohibit, should someone want, use in a commercial product or to prohibit manufacture by anyone for sale, including any of the Chinese companies who produce the boards us tinkerers love to... tinker with.
